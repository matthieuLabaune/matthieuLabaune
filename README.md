## Hi, I'm Matthieu ðŸ‘‹

### Currently
- :mortar_board: I'm currently training at "[Campus NumÃ©rique in the Alps](https://le-campus-numerique.fr/)" in order to become a web developer.
- :skull: PhD in prehistoric archaeology, I'm in professional transition.
- ðŸŒ± In the last two weeks, I have been studying algorithmics through [sorting algorithms & recursivity](https://github.com/matthieuLabaune/Javascript_Sorting-algorithms).
- ðŸ¤” I recently started a new job as a Laravel developer at the [French Handisport Federation](http://www.handisport.org/) in order to complete my professional reconversion.
- :zap: I'm working to improve the federation's existing extranet and adding new functionalities (Laravel, Vue.js, Mysql, Github).
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m developing a blog in order to present my professional reconversion.
